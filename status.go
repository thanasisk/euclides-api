		// Alloc is bytes of allocated heap objects.
		Alloc uint64

		// Sys is the total bytes of memory obtained from the OS.
		//
		Sys uint64

		// Lookups is the number of pointer lookups performed by the
		// runtime.
		//
		// This is primarily useful for debugging runtime internals.
		Lookups uint64

		// Mallocs is the cumulative count of heap objects allocated.
		// The number of live objects is Mallocs - Frees.
		Mallocs uint64

		// Frees is the cumulative count of heap objects freed.
		Frees uint64

		// HeapAlloc is bytes of allocated heap objects.
		//
		// "Allocated" heap objects include all reachable objects, as
		// well as unreachable objects that the garbage collector has
		// not yet freed. Specifically, HeapAlloc increases as heap
		// objects are allocated and decreases as the heap is swept
		// and unreachable objects are freed. Sweeping occurs
		// incrementally between GC cycles, so these two processes
		// occur simultaneously, and as a result HeapAlloc tends to
		// change smoothly (in contrast with the sawtooth that is
		// typical of stop-the-world garbage collectors).
		HeapAlloc uint64

		// HeapSys is bytes of heap memory obtained from the OS.
		//
		// HeapSys measures the amount of virtual address space
		// reserved for the heap. This includes virtual address space
		// that has been reserved but not yet used, which consumes no
		// physical memory, but tends to be small, as well as virtual
		// address space for which the physical memory has been
		// returned to the OS after it became unused (see HeapReleased
		// for a measure of the latter).
		//
		// HeapSys estimates the largest size the heap has had.
		HeapSys uint64

		// HeapIdle is bytes in idle (unused) spans.
		//
		// Idle spans have no objects in them. These spans could be
		// (and may already have been) returned to the OS, or they can
		// be reused for heap allocations, or they can be reused as
		// stack memory.
		//
		// HeapIdle minus HeapReleased estimates the amount of memory
		// that could be returned to the OS, but is being retained by
		// the runtime so it can grow the heap without requesting more
		// memory from the OS. If this difference is significantly
		// larger than the heap size, it indicates there was a recent
		// transient spike in live heap size.
		HeapIdle uint64

		// HeapInuse is bytes in in-use spans.
		//
		// In-use spans have at least one object in them. These spans
		// can only be used for other objects of roughly the same
		// size.
		//
		// HeapInuse minus HeapAlloc estimates the amount of memory
		// that has been dedicated to particular size classes, but is
		// not currently being used. This is an upper bound on
		// fragmentation, but in general this memory can be reused
		// efficiently.
		HeapInuse uint64

		// HeapReleased is bytes of physical memory returned to the OS.
		//
		// This counts heap memory from idle spans that was returned
		// to the OS and has not yet been reacquired for the heap.
		HeapReleased uint64

		// HeapObjects is the number of allocated heap objects.
		//
		// Like HeapAlloc, this increases as objects are allocated and
		// decreases as the heap is swept and unreachable objects are
		// freed.
		HeapObjects uint64

		// StackInuse is bytes in stack spans.
		//
		// In-use stack spans have at least one stack in them. These
		// spans can only be used for other stacks of the same size.
		//
		// There is no StackIdle because unused stack spans are
		// returned to the heap (and hence counted toward HeapIdle).
		StackInuse uint64

		// StackSys is bytes of stack memory obtained from the OS.
		//
		// StackSys is StackInuse, plus any memory obtained directly
		// from the OS for OS thread stacks (which should be minimal).
		StackSys uint64

		// MSpanInuse is bytes of allocated mspan structures.
		MSpanInuse uint64

		// MSpanSys is bytes of memory obtained from the OS for mspan
		// structures.
		MSpanSys uint64

		// MCacheInuse is bytes of allocated mcache structures.
		MCacheInuse uint64

		// MCacheSys is bytes of memory obtained from the OS for
		// mcache structures.
		MCacheSys uint64

		// BuckHashSys is bytes of memory in profiling bucket hash tables.
		BuckHashSys uint64

		// GCSys is bytes of memory in garbage collection metadata.
		GCSys uint64 // Go 1.2

		// OtherSys is bytes of memory in miscellaneous off-heap
		// runtime allocations.
		OtherSys uint64 // Go 1.2

		// NextGC is the target heap size of the next GC cycle.
		//
		// The garbage collector's goal is to keep HeapAlloc ≤ NextGC.
		// At the end of each GC cycle, the target for the next cycle
		// is computed based on the amount of reachable data and the
		// value of GOGC.
		NextGC uint64

		// LastGC is the time the last garbage collection finished, as
		// nanoseconds since 1970 (the UNIX epoch).
		LastGC uint64

		// PauseTotalNs is the cumulative nanoseconds in GC
		// stop-the-world pauses since the program started.
		//
		// During a stop-the-world pause, all goroutines are paused
		// and only the garbage collector can run.
		PauseTotalNs uint64

		// PauseNs is a circular buffer of recent GC stop-the-world
		// pause times in nanoseconds.
		//
		// The most recent pause is at PauseNs[(NumGC+255)%256]. In
		// general, PauseNs[N%256] records the time paused in the most
		// recent N%256th GC cycle. There may be multiple pauses per
		// GC cycle; this is the sum of all pauses during a cycle.
		PauseNs [256]uint64

		// PauseEnd is a circular buffer of recent GC pause end times,
		// as nanoseconds since 1970 (the UNIX epoch).
		//
		// This buffer is filled the same way as PauseNs. There may be
		// multiple pauses per GC cycle; this records the end of the
		// last pause in a cycle.
		PauseEnd [256]uint64 // Go 1.4

		// NumGC is the number of completed GC cycles.
		NumGC uint32

		// NumForcedGC is the number of GC cycles that were forced by
		// the application calling the GC function.
		NumForcedGC uint32 // Go 1.8

		// GCCPUFraction is the fraction of this program's available
		// CPU time used by the GC since the program started.
		//
		// GCCPUFraction is expressed as a number between 0 and 1,
		// where 0 means GC has consumed none of this program's CPU. A
		// program's available CPU time is defined as the integral of
		// GOMAXPROCS since the program started. That is, if
		// GOMAXPROCS is 2 and a program has been running for 10
		// seconds, its "available CPU" is 20 seconds. GCCPUFraction
		// does not include CPU time used for write barrier activity.
		//
		// This is the same as the fraction of CPU reported by
		// GODEBUG=gctrace=1.
		GCCPUFraction float64 // Go 1.5
